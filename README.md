# Tower-Bridge-Lift-Times
Scraps the schedule for Tower Bridge to a Google calendar and Twitter feed (TODO).

Each lift has three data points:
 - Datetime (e.g. 27 Aug 2021 17:45)
 - Vessel Name (e.g. Motor Vessel Dutch Master)
 - Direction ("Up river" or "Down river")

Note that multiple boats may partake in the same lift.
